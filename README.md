# apache-manager
Simple menubar Apache manager written in Swift. This is the result of an evening trying out Swift.
Clicking on the menu items will execute the corresponding shell commands *without* checking for errors or any other kind of validation.
Since there is no easy way of asking for elevated privileges in Swift, I had to get along with the hacky NSAppleScript approach.
